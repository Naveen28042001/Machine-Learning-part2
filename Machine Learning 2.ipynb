    "Regularization in machine learning is a set of techniques used to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization performance of machine learning models. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including noise or irrelevant patterns, leading to poor performance on unseen data. Regularization techniques add a penalty term to the loss function, discouraging the model from fitting the training data too closely and promoting simpler models. Some common regularization techniques include:\n",

    "1.L2 Regularization (Ridge Regression):\n",
    "\n",
    "How it Works: \n",
    "    Adds a penalty term proportional to the square of the magnitude of the model's coefficients to the loss function. It encourages the model to find a balance between fitting the training data and keeping the model weights small.\n",
    "Effect on Overfitting: \n",
    "   Helps reduce the model's sensitivity to noise in the training data and prevents the coefficients from becoming too large, thereby reducing overfitting.\n",
    "2.L1 Regularization (Lasso Regression):\n",
    "\n",
    "How it Works: \n",
    "    Adds a penalty term proportional to the absolute value of the model's coefficients to the loss function. It encourages sparsity in the model by forcing some coefficients to be exactly zero.\n",
    "Effect on Overfitting: \n",
